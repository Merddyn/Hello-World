# Hello-World
What can I say? I'm new here.

Uhhhh basically I'm a newbie developer trying to break into the exciting world of software development while working a receiving job. At the time of writing this, I've made a very basic weekend of programaming game in C# (After finishing a book on the subject), done a semester of studying C++ in school, and partially automated the receiving process at work using AutoHotKey. I'm in the process of learning how to work in Unreal using C++ to help with my friend's game project, and will be starting school studying C# and web development at the beginning of the spring semester.
